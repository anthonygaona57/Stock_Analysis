# Stock_Analysis
Overview of Project:
The Analysis for this project shows Steve wanting to help his parents by investing in green energy. Steveâ€™s parents want to invest in DAQO green energy, while he wants to look at all green energy companies that occurred in 2017 and 2018. He wants to understand which kinds of energy would be the best for the long run. We would use VBA to identify which green energy performance is the best in 2017 and 2018. It also shows the results of the return percentages of the tickers and stocks of total daily volume.

Results:
 (2017)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110862037/185450573-3ad229ff-6fc3-4756-b527-bbe87fc3f620.png)

 
(2018)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110862037/185450706-85025197-b55a-4184-88cd-03495cfde5ee.png)


Comparing 2017 and 2018 stock shows the stock dropped considerably except for a few. From these two results, 2017 had a better DQ in the future while increasing the high and volume return values percentages. In 2018, the picture is completely different in that the other two green stocks had a better view, including Run and ENPH. While DQ had negative statistics, it would lower the total volume and decrease returning, thus showing the stock value diminishing. RUN had a huge change; ENPH is shown as a relativity stable stock while providing a beneficial increase in 2017 and 2018.


Summary:
The disadvantage of refactoring code can be risky when the analysis is too big and when developers would often have trouble understanding the purpose of the project. But, an advantage is that it can be an easier way to provide the code, making the code neat and organized. The pros and cons while refactoring the VBA script is that it could be seven times faster than applying the original code.
